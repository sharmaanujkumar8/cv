	<h2>Electrical Circuit Elements can be</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Linear or Non-Linear</li>
		<li>Active or Passive</li>
		<li>Unilateral or Bilateral</li>
		<li>Time-Variant or Time-Invariant</li>
	</ul>

		<li><h3>Linear or Non-Linear </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Linear Elements:</h4>

V-I characteristics follows only one equation of straight line passing through origine.
Examples : Resistors, Inductors, Capacitors and Gyrator
				</li>

				<li><h4>Non-Linear Elements:</h4>

Elements lacking any of the above mentioned characteristics for linear elements are Non-Linear Elements.
Examples : Diodes, Transistors etc..
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li><h3>Active or Passive</h3>
			<ul> 
				<li><h4>Active Elements:</h4>

Active circuit elements have capacity of enhancing the energy level of signal passing through it. Slope of  V-I characteristics  of such elements is negative OR any part of V-I characteristics of such elements lies in 2nd or/and 4th Quadrant
Example : Vacuum Tubes, Transistors, Power Sources...</li>

				<li><h4>Passive Elements:</h4>

Passive elements can’t enhance the energy level of signals passing through it. Their V-I characteristics never touches 2nd of 4th quadrant.
Example : Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors</li>
			</ul>

<br>
<em>During discharging period energy storing elements like Capacitors and Inductors Behaves like Active Elements ( slope of their v-i characteristic becomes negative) but their overall V-I characteristic never touches 2nd or 4th quadrant ( if you start drawing V-I characteristic when stored energy of element is zero), So they are Passive Elements.
</em>





		<li><h3>Unilateral or Bilateral</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Unilateral Elements:</h4>

If the magnitude of current passing through an element changes or affected due to changes in polarity of applied voltage, the element is Unilateral Element.
Example : Diodes, Transistors, SCRs. . . 
				</li>

				<li><h4>Bilateral Elements:</h4>

If the magnitude of current remains the same OR if V-I characterises of an element remains unchanged  OR if the element offers same impedance ——&gt;&gt; even if the polarity of applied voltage 
is reversed then it is a Bilateral Element
Example : All linear elements.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
			
			



		<li><h3>Time-Variant or Time-Invariant</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Time-Variant Elements:</h4>

V-I characteristic changes with time.
				</li>
				<li><h4>Time-Variant Elements:</h4>

V-I characteristics remains same for all time.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
	</ol>
